## Description

This Streamlit application is a fun and educational quiz designed to test your knowledge of HTTP response codes. It utilizes the adorable `http.cat` API to display cat images corresponding to each HTTP code, making learning enjoyable.

**A demo of this app can be found [here](https://httpcats.streamlit.app).**

## Features

* **Quiz Format:** Presents multiple-choice questions about HTTP response codes.
* **Interactive UI:** Uses Streamlit's `st.radio` for interactive question selection.
* **Score Tracking:** Calculates and displays the user's score upon submission.
* **Visual Feedback:** Provides "Correct" or "Incorrect" feedback for each question.
* **Cat Images:** Displays cat images from `http.cat` corresponding to the correct HTTP response codes.
* **Session State:** Uses `st.session_state` to maintain the quiz state across reruns, preventing data loss.
* **Caching:** Uses `@st.cache_data` to improve performance by caching the loading of images.
